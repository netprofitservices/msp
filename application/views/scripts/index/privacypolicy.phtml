						<ul>
							<li>We don&rsquo;t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can&rsquo;t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
							<li>We don&rsquo;t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, deliver our products/services, or protect our rights.</li>
							<li>We don&rsquo;t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
							<li>In our network/member portal, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what&rsquo;s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</li>

								<header><h2>Website Visitors</h2></header>
								
								<p>Like most website operators, MSP collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, 
								language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. MSP&rsquo;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better 
								understand how MSP&rsquo;s visitors use its website. From time to time, MSP may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
								
								<p>MSP also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users filling out requests for services. MSP only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

								<header><h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2></header>
									<p>Certain visitors to MSP&rsquo;s websites choose to interact with MSP in ways that require MSP to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that MSP gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for our network at MainstreamPreppers.com to provide a zip code and email address. Those who engage in transactions with MSP &mdash; by purchasing access to preparedness school, for example &mdash; are asked to provide additional information, 
									including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, MSP collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor&rsquo;s interaction with MSP. MSP does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

								<header><h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2></header>
									<p>MSP may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, MSP may monitor the most popular pages, articles, videos, or courses on its website. MSP may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, MSP does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

								<header><h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2></header>
									<p>MSP discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on MSP’s behalf or to provide services available at MSP’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using MSP’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. </p>
									
									<p>Example releases of your information to an affiliated organization are: </p>
									<ol>
									<li>If you elect to participate in a live training offered by one of our instructors.  Your name and email may be released to the instructor so they can send you important event details directly.</li>
									<li>If you sign up for a live webinar, we&rsquo;ll release your email to webinar facilitator so that you may receive an invite and instructions to connect to the event.</li>
									</ol>
									
											
									<p><b>MSP will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.</b> Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, MSP discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when MSP believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of MSP, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an MSP website and have supplied your email address, MSP may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with MSP and our products. We primarily use our various websites to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. MSP takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of MSP may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
