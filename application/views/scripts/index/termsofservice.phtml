			<p> This Statement of Terms of Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) governs our relationship with other users who interact with this website. By using or accessing the member area of our website, you agree to these terms:</p>

								<header><h2>Privacy</h2></header>
								
								<p>Our website enables you to share information with people around you. You choose the level of privacy you select for your profile, from totally anonymous and nearly invisible to reasonably public. The information you put in your profile, including contact and personal information, pictures, interests, may be visible to other members.  Such information is public on the website and should not be posted if intended to be kept private.</p>
								
<p>Additionally, groups you join, comments and messages you post, and events you note you&rsquo;ll attend will be public information. Please refrain from posting private information on this network.</p>
<p>If you have great privacy concerns &ndash; we encourage you to select &ldquo;anonymous&rdquo; as your profile type.  </p>

<p>This will block anyone from knowing really anything about you, seeing actions, etc.  But it may also limit some of your functionality when using the website.</p>
<p>Additionally, you should seek permission from any third party before posting any information about that person that they may desire to keep private. This may be locations, dates, comments, and pictures. Do not infringe upon the privacy rights of others with this network. Such disrespect for the privacy of others will not be tolerated.  If you have questions or ideas related to privacy on our network, please contact us.</p>
